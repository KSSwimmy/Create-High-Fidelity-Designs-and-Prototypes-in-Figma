# WEEK 5

### Introduction to high-fidelity prototypes

#### Low-fidelity prototypes 
Interactive versions of designs that use content placeholders 

#### High-fidelity prototypes 
high-fidelity prototypes are detailed, interactive versions of designs that closely match the look and feel of the final product.

#### A high-fidelity prototype must have these three pieces: 
- visual elements like color, images, icons, and typography 
- navigation to help users move between screens 
- interaction, like gestures and motion, which make the prototype function

#### When checking the navigation in a high-fidelity prototype, ask yourself these questions: 
- How does a user get from one screen to the next? 
- How easy is it to locate navigation-related icons, like back arrows? 
- At what point does the user journey end? 

Finally, a high-fidelity prototype needs interactivity.
