# WEEK 5

### Introduction to high-fidelity prototypes

#### Low-fidelity prototypes 
Interactive versions of designs that use content placeholders 

#### High-fidelity prototypes 
high-fidelity prototypes are detailed, interactive versions of designs that closely match the look and feel of the final product.

#### A high-fidelity prototype must have these three pieces: 
- visual elements like color, images, icons, and typography 
- navigation to help users move between screens 
- interaction, like gestures and motion, which make the prototype function

#### When checking the navigation in a high-fidelity prototype, ask yourself these questions: 
- How does a user get from one screen to the next? 
- How easy is it to locate navigation-related icons, like back arrows? 
- At what point does the user journey end? 

Finally, a high-fidelity prototype needs interactivity.

### Create a high-fidelity prototype in Figma

There are six steps to create a high-fidelity prototype in Figma. Those six steps are: 

- lay out the mockups 
- connect the screens 
- add interaction details
- adjust the animation
- complete for all screens
- share your work

### Gestures and motion in UX design

A **gesture** is any method of interaction a user has with information on their device using touch.

The most common gestures are tapping, scrolling, swiping, and zooming.

**Motion** is a way to automate static design elements to focus the user's attention and tell stories.

### Reading: Explore types of gestures and motion

**Gestures** are any method of interaction a user has with information on their device using touch. In other words, gestures describe how you interact with a screen using your finger or a stylus. Common gestures include:

**Swipe.** A swipe is a brief brushing of the screen with a fingertip horizontally or vertically. A swipe can be used to move from one screen of an app to another. It can also be used to interact with a carousel of content.

**Tap.** A tap is a brief touch of the screen by the user. Taps can be customized from the use of one fingertip to four fingertips. Single-finger tapping is often used to select an item on the screen. Two-finger tapping is often used as a shortcut to make the context menu (also known as the right-click menu) appear.

**Drag.** The drag gesture provides users the ability to slide across the surface of a device to move it in and out of view. Drag is often used for the main notification menu on mobile devices.

**Pinch.** Using two fingers simultaneously, a pinch is the movement of fingers closing into each other or moving away from one another. A pinch allows users to scale items on a screen like changing the size of a website. It is also used to zoom in and out of maps and photos. 

While some of these gestures may seem familiar, they aren't always universal across all devices or operating systems. For example, the scroll and pan gesture on a mobile device doesnâ€™t have the same function on a laptop touchpad. An Apple or an Android phone might assign different functionality to a gesture as well. When you include gestures in your devices, it's good practice to look at how other products use these gestures so you can design accessible, familiar products for your users.
