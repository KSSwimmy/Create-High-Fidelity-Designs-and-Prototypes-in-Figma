### Give and receive feedback as a UX designer

It's important for UX designers to understand their personal values and any biases they might have because of the influence it can have on your designs. In the same way, it's a good idea to reflect on how much feedback you are giving and receiving at each stage of a project.

#### Ask yourself: 

- Am I comfortable sharing my opinons about another designer's project? 

- Am I checking in regularly with team members to get feedback on my designs? 

#### Advantages of receiving feedback 

- Improve your designs 
- Build your confidence and skills 
- Broaden your perspective as a designer

### The basics of design critique sessions

A **design critique session** is a planned period of time where UX designers present their work to team members and listen to feedback.

In a design critique, participants can play one of three main roles: **Facilitator**, **presenter**, or a **reviewer**.

The **facilitator**, their job is to run the crit session and guide the process.

**presenter** This is the designer who is sharing their work with others in the session. 

 The final role is the reviewer or critic. The **reviewer** gives feedback about the design and offers clear actions to take. There is usually more than one reviewer in a design critique. At some point in your UX design career, you'll have an opportunity to be in each of these roles. That's why it's important to know how all three of the roles work together during a design critique.

**Notetaker** - This person can capture all of the ideas and feedback from the reviewers so that the presenter can stay fully present and focused.

#### Example of a structure that a design critique session might fullow 

- The facilitator provides an overview of the design critique session and defines the objectives, or the goals of the design critique. 
- The presenter shares their design work.
- Reviewers take turns explaining their feedback
