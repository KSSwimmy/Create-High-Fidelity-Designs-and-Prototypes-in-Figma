### Give and receive feedback as a UX designer

It's important for UX designers to understand their personal values and any biases they might have because of the influence it can have on your designs. In the same way, it's a good idea to reflect on how much feedback you are giving and receiving at each stage of a project.

#### Ask yourself: 

- Am I comfortable sharing my opinons about another designer's project? 

- Am I checking in regularly with team members to get feedback on my designs? 

#### Advantages of receiving feedback 

- Improve your designs 
- Build your confidence and skills 
- Broaden your perspective as a designer

### The basics of design critique sessions

A **design critique session** is a planned period of time where UX designers present their work to team members and listen to feedback.

In a design critique, participants can play one of three main roles: **Facilitator**, **presenter**, or a **reviewer**.

The **facilitator**, their job is to run the crit session and guide the process.

**presenter** This is the designer who is sharing their work with others in the session. 

 The final role is the reviewer or critic. The **reviewer** gives feedback about the design and offers clear actions to take. There is usually more than one reviewer in a design critique. At some point in your UX design career, you'll have an opportunity to be in each of these roles. That's why it's important to know how all three of the roles work together during a design critique.

**Notetaker** - This person can capture all of the ideas and feedback from the reviewers so that the presenter can stay fully present and focused.

#### Example of a structure that a design critique session might fullow 

- The facilitator provides an overview of the design critique session and defines the objectives, or the goals of the design critique. 
- The presenter shares their design work.
- Reviewers take turns explaining their feedback

### Best practices for design critique sessions

#### Questions to focus on when preparing your presentation 

- Who are you designing for? 
- What problem are you trying to solve?
- How are your designs solving or not solving these problems? 
- Where in the design process are you? 
- What aspects of your designs are you seeking feedback on? 

#### Best practices for presenters during a crit session 
- Take in the feedback, and decide if you want to ask for clarification or respond 
- Focus on active listening

### Reading: Learn more about design critique sessions

The facilitator of a design critique is in charge of running the critique session and guiding the feedback process. They may keep track of the time and create the agenda and goals for the meeting. 

The **facilitator** is also responsible for ensuring everyone in the meeting is included and gets to share their ideas. Whether it’s because of a personality trait of an individual or a bias of the group, some people are going to be left out of the process if they’re not directly engaged. The facilitator makes sure each person gets an opportunity to share. Not all design critiques include a facilitator, but in many cases, especially when working with a large team, one can be very helpful.

The **presenter** is the designer sharing their work with the team throughout the session. This could also be a group of designers who worked together. They might share their designs directly from Figma or Adobe XD, like a screen share, or they might create a presentation in Google Slides or Microsoft PowerPoint with images of their designs. As a designer, you’ll often take on the role of presenter. Make sure you engage with others in the meeting and prepare to ask questions and offer feedback. 

The **reviewers** offer feedback on the designs presented and what steps are needed to improve the designs. There are often multiple reviewers and multiple critique sessions to look at the design from different perspectives. 

Additionally, there may be a fourth role of **notetaker**, who documents the ideas and keeps track of all the feedback so the conversations can flow without interruption. The notetaker will likely record notes in a digital document so the notes can be shared with the entire group later.

Together, all of these roles work to create effective solutions to strengthen your designs. Throughout your UX design career, you’ll get the chance to facilitate, present, and review in a critique session.
