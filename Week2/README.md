### Scale and proportion in UX design

**Scale** is a concept that's used to explain the size relationship between a given element and the other elements in the design.

**Proportion** is about the balance or harmony between elements that are scaled.

In other words, proportion helps UX designers make sure the size relationship between elements makes sense.

### Unity and variety in UX design


**Unity** measures how well elements of your design work together to communicate an idea.

Unity can be created by using a consistent color scheme, complementary fonts, and consistent spacing.

On the other end of the spectrum is **variety**, which is about varying the elements in your design to break up monotony.
