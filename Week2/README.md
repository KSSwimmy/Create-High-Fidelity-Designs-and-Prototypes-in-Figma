# WEEK 2

### Scale and proportion in UX design

**Scale** is a concept that's used to explain the size relationship between a given element and the other elements in the design.

**Proportion** is about the balance or harmony between elements that are scaled.

In other words, proportion helps UX designers make sure the size relationship between elements makes sense.

### Unity and variety in UX design


**Unity** measures how well elements of your design work together to communicate an idea.

Unity can be created by using a consistent color scheme, complementary fonts, and consistent spacing.

On the other end of the spectrum is **variety**, which is about varying the elements in your design to break up monotony.

### Reading: Use unity and variety in mockups

In the course video, you learned about how the concepts of unity and variety can be incorporated into the designs that you create to keep the attention of users and improve their engagement with your product.

**Unity** measures how well design elements work together to create a consolidated design idea. 

**Variety** refers to diversifying the elements in your design to break up monotony and create visual interest.

By relying on a design principle like unity, UX designers can communicate a single idea using unity between the different elements in a design. This can often be the difference between okay UI design and amazing UI design! Using variety allows designers to use different, but similar, elements to keep the attention of their users. Repetition is a great tool for UX designers to use, but too much of it can exhaust the user and lead to them disengaging from the product. 

Let’s explore a couple of real-world examples of unity and variety in action.

#### Unity
Your design is much more than elements on a frame. Unity is how all of those elements come together to help users as they meet the goal you’ve established for your product design. You can think of it as all of the elements unifying together to paint the design that you’ve been imaging as you build this mockup. 

As you start thinking about unity for use throughout your products, there are a few things that you can look for:

- How elements align with each other
- The shape of elements 
- Continuity within text elements

You can see those highlighted in the elements of the YouTube Music app below:

#### How elements align with each other

The way elements take up space within an app is just as important as the designs themselves. If you look at the example highlighted on the left, you’ll see that YouTube Music app shows app videos and favorite artists. Videos are rectangles that take up the entire width of the screen, and the Favorites are circles that have a different width. These two red shapes overlaid on the app are the same size. These red boxes show that these elements align with one another not because of the shape, but because of the unity within how much space they occupy on the screen. 

#### The shape of elements 

You’ve already learned about how element shape can use proportion to improve the way that users interact with your designs. Now you get to see how the shape of elements can improve the unity of the designs on the YouTube music app. On the second screen, you can see how the playlists boxes have the same scale, proportion, and size. These red squares are all the same size. There are many different principles happening on this screen of the app, but there’s no doubt that the design of the boxes makes this design feel clean, organized, and easy to navigate. 

### Continuity within text elements

Previously in this course, we talked about the importance of choosing a font, font color, and font size. You can see how text within the YouTube Music fits together and improves the unity of the designs. On the third and final graphic above, you’ll see that there are two text element types highlighted: section headings and descriptions. The section headings have the same color, the same font, and the same alignment. The descriptions also share the same color, the same font, and the same alignment, even when the descriptions are longer than the allowed space for the descriptions. All these choices contribute to keeping the app flow unified. Each element, text included, has a place, and it never breaks out of the space.

#### Applying unity to your mocks
As you think about unity in your product design, think about the goal statement you’ve created. Now think about all of the elements you are considering adding to your design. How is every single element that you’re creating working to meet that goal? If you can’t answer that question, it might be time to reconsider the purpose of the element in your design.

#### Variety
Your users' interest in your designs often relies on how well you present the elements to them. As a UX designer, you will likely work on some truly exciting projects, but you’ll also work on run-of-the-mill (some might even say boring!) products. In situations like that, it’s important that you understand how variety can improve the way users interact with your product. 

The Google Photos app features one solution for implementing variety into its design.

You’ll notice the variety with the size of the images above. The designers at Google Photos could have chosen to maintain the typical square grid representing the images throughout this collection of photos. Instead, the designers chose to have some images keep their original dimensions as rectangles. These rectangles are interspersed among the square image in an aesthetically pleasing way. This variety within the images and keeps users engaged with the app. 

#### Applying variety to your mocks
Part of becoming a successful UX designer is finding ways to keep users excited about your product. Even if that product isn’t very exciting! Applying some variety to your elements can go a long way towards keeping your users interested in the design you’ve created. Are there any areas of your mocks that you feel are too repetitive? Think about what you’ve learned about variety and try something a little bit different.

### Apply Gestalt Principles to mockups

To refresh your memory, **Gestalt principles** describe how humans group similar elements, recognize patterns, and simplify complex images when we perceive objects.

**Which Gestalt Principle states that elements that are close together appear to be more related compared to elements spaced farther apart?**

- Proximity

**Consider the following scenario:** 

**Emile is creating an app that lets people rent bicycles. Users can check in, check out, and pay for their rental with it. Emile wants users to associate the brand color—vermillion red—with the check-out process by indicating successful progress with check marks in this color. Emile  wants to make buttons, such as “Next” and “Complete Order” to follow the same theme. Which Gestalt principle is this comparable to?**

- Similarity

### Learn about additional Gestalt Principles

As a reminder, Gestalt Principles describe how humans group similar elements, recognize patterns, and simplify complex images when we perceive objects. In other words, the human brain will attempt to simplify and organize complex images by subconsciously arranging the parts into a cohesive whole. Applying Gestalt Principles in your mockups will help create user-friendly designs that are rooted in psychology and human behavior. 

So far in this certificate program, you’ve learned about three Gestalt Principles:

- **Similarity:** Elements that look similar are perceived to have the same function.
- **Proximity:** Elements that are close together appear to be more related than elements that are spaced farther apart. 
- **Common region:** Elements located within the same area are perceived to be grouped together.

Now, you’ll explore three additional Gestalt Principles: closure, continuity, and symmetry.

**Closure** is the principle that describes the fact that when a user looks at an incomplete object, they subconsciously complete the image to see the whole, completed object. This happens because the human brain naturally simplifies complex elements. 

The graphic above is technically a bunch of different colored lines — but those lines imply shapes. The human brain perceives lines as a red square, a blue circle, and a yellow triangle because of the desire for closure. 

Using the principle of closure can keep users engaged with your designs by improving a user’s attention to objects. There are many different shapes and objects that can be perceived in different company logos. Here’s an example of continuity within the FedEx logo.

In the FedEx logo, shown above, there is a subtle example of continuity. Can you spot it? Between the E and x, the white space forms an arrow pointing right. There is no outline or distinction on this arrow, but users can see it because the shape of the E and the x come together, without touching, to provide the illusion of the arrow. For FedEx, this arrow is more than the closure principle; it also fits in with their brand’s purpose of shipping items for their users (it implies moving forward in a particular direction).

To read about a few of the ways that you can apply closure to your product designs to reflect the purpose of your product, here’s an article from the UX Collective: Improve Your Designs With The Principles Of Closure And Figure-Ground.

**Continuity** is the principle of guiding a user’s eye from object to object. Using this principle forces the user’s attention to specific areas or paths on the screen. In the graphic above, your eye is led from the first circle, through the second, and to the third because your eye is “following” the line as it moves across the graphic.

Since humans naturally follow paths, lines, and curves of a design, UX designers can use continuity to help guide users as they move in a particular direction toward a goal in a product. It's pleasing to the human eye to experience continuity through visuals, like in the graphic above. 

Here’s an example of how the continuity principle works in this navigation menu on the website for the United States Postal Service (USPS).

Users come to the USPS website to learn many types of information. Imagine that you are looking for information about sending a package. Your first stop would be to click “Send” in the navigation menu. Then your gaze moves to “Learn About” because you are interested in learning how to send a package. Next, your gaze moves down to “Sending” because that’s what you’re looking to do. There you find the link to learning about sending packages. 

The principle of continuity is used here to lead the eyes vertically through the navigation menu to help the user find the answers they’re looking for. It happens so quickly that the user likely doesn’t realize that they’ve gone through three levels of menus to find the link they’re searching for. 

Continuity is a fantastic way of giving your user exactly what they want from all of your elements, not just navigation. Here’s a link to an article from UXCam that breaks down the right and wrong ways you can use continuity as you design: Gestalt Principles: The Complete Overview.

Another way that users can perceive elements is based on the way that they look in relation to each other: whether they are symmetrical or asymmetrical. 

**Symmetry** is the idea that elements are more visually pleasing when the parts of a shape or an object are balanced or are mirror images of each other. The human brain perceives objects that are symmetrical as more pleasing, as well as related to each other. 

**Asymmetry** is the idea that a lack of balance and equality in a shape or object can emphasize its importance and create visual interest. Asymmetry can help call attention to a specific item or grouping of items or add visual movement to an image.

On the left of the graphic above you can see how symmetry works. The dark green shape on the left side of the graphic is duplicated on the right, lighter green side of the shape. There are no visual differences between them other than the shade of green used. On the right side of the graphic, you have an example of asymmetry. There's a dark green shape on the left with areas that use straight lines but to the left, the yellow image uses all curved lines. While the yellow shape has the same proportion as the dark green shape, the shapes are not the same. 

While asymmetry is not technically a Gestalt Principle, symmetry and asymmetry go hand-in-hand when talking about how symmetry can affect the users that you’re designing for. Symmetry creates harmony that is easy to visualize in your designs, while asymmetry calls the attention of your users. When used well, asymmetry creates visual interest.

Here’s an example of symmetry in action on the homepage for Instapaper.

The weight of all of the content on this page is symmetrical. With everything weighted toward the middle, new users know exactly what they should be looking at on this page: the brief lines of copy, the device that is in the middle of the screen, and the button to create an account to use the product. 

As you design, consider if symmetry will work for your users' needs. Are there any pages that you can simplify and add visual weight to on one area of the screen? If symmetry won’t work for your design, maybe asymmetry will. 

This is a great example of asymmetry from the website of the Alan Turing Institute.

This website uses asymmetry to organize content by placing a block of text toward the center and two smaller blocks of text close by toward the upper left. The text size here is what guides users to the more important information on this homepage. 

But, this website also does something really interesting underneath the text and on top of the background image. There is an animated shape that is sloped beneath the smaller text to the upper right that points directly toward the text in the middle. So, if the user’s eyes aren’t drawn to the bigger text in the beginning the sloped shape will guide the user’s eyes to look to that area first. 

Asymmetry is all about creating visual interest for users. Are you finding that your product design must have certain elements on the page that you think may be distracting? Try asymmetry! You may find that changing the visual weight of your elements and their positions is exactly what your design needs to give your users exactly what they need. 

As you continue to think about how you can use symmetry and asymmetry in your designs, check out a video from Skillshare that speaks to the depth of these principles and how they work in design and in the world: Symmetry vs. Asymmetry in Graphic Design.
