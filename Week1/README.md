### Introduction to Mockups

In UX, **fidelity** means how closely a design matches the look and feel of the final product.

If a design is **low fidelity**, that means it has a lower amount of complexity and is less refined or polished.

If a design is **high fidelity**, that means it closely matches the look and feel of the final product and is more refined or polished overall.

A **mockup** is a static, high-fidelity design that is used as a representation of a final product.

### Reading: Accessibility considerations for color

Color is one of the ways that you, as a designer, can connect with the emotions of users and draw attention to certain parts of a design. But when you design a product, it’s important to think about how color is interpreted by all users of the product. Some users will have difficulty perceiving certain colors or color combinations, so the information that the colors of your design convey could be lost. It’s critical that your designs are inclusive and reflect the diverse needs of the product's users. Plus, designing with accessibility in mind makes it easier for all users to interact with your designs.

There are many resources to help designers use color in ways that are accessible to a wide range of people. For example, W3C recognized the need for improving accessibility for people with disabilities, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, and neurological disabilities. So, they developed the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), which are a series of guidelines for improving web accessibility. 

How can you use the WCAG in your own designs? Let's explore.

#### Color blindness

**Color blindness** results in difficulty distinguishing between certain colors. There are three common categories of color blindness: red-green, blue-yellow, and total color blindness. To understand how color blindness can affect how users see color, visit the Colblindor Color Blindness Simulator, where you can upload images and check them through various colorblind filters. 

There are a few ways to keep color accessibility in mind as you design: 

**1. Use icons in designs**, in addition to color. For example, check out the image below: if you’re designing a form and want to indicate that a field is missing text or formatted incorrectly, do not solely rely on turning incorrect text to the color red. You should also use a red exclamation point icon. The exclamation point icon will draw users' attention to the form field with the color and the icon, so your designs will be clearer to more users.

**2. Use patterns and texture to create contrast.** Contrast is the difference between two or more elements in a design. Contrast is often created through black and white imagery, or the large size of header text versus the smaller size of body text. Imagine you're creating a bar graph about user research using a client’s brand colors. To create contrast without relying on color alone, you can add subtle stripes to one column and dots to another, as shown in the image below. With contrasting patterns, in addition to color, the bars in the graph will be clearly differentiated for all users.

**3. Avoid color combinations that could be hard to distinguish from** one another. Here are some color combinations that are often difficult for users who are color blind to differentiate between: 

- Green & red
- Green & brown
- Blue & purple
- Green & blue
- Light green & yellow
- Blue & gray
- Green & gray
- Green & black

Keep in mind: If you use green in your designs, that doesn’t mean you need to avoid red, brown, blue, and gray altogether. But because these colors can be hard to distinguish, it’s better to not put those colors directly next to each other, especially for critical information. In addition, you should create other forms of contrast, like adding written labels to differentiate important facts. Check out the image below to understand these best practices in action!

The key takeaway here? Your designs should convey information in multiple ways beyond just a single color, such as using icons, patterns, textures, and easily distinguishable color combinations.

#### Low contrast sensitivity

People who have **low contrast sensitivity** experience objects as dim or unclear, which makes those objects more difficult for a person to identify. Many people experience low contrast sensitivity on a daily basis. For example, people who have a high visual acuity experience low contrast sensitivity when it’s dark and a digital screen is too bright, or when it’s bright and a digital screen is too dark. In addition, as people’s eyes get older, their contrast sensitivity naturally weakens.

One way that you can design with low contrast sensitivity in mind is to use the **luminosity contrast ratio**, which is a measurement of the contrast between the background and the text color used on top of that background. As a standard, the WCAG recommends that the luminosity contrast ratio of images and text meets a contrast ratio of at least 4.5 : 1. 

What exactly does that mean for your designs? Check out these four examples of contrast ratios in action:

- Low contrast has a ratio of 2 : 1. As you can tell, the background color and text are difficult to read.
- Minimum contrast has a ratio of 4.5 : 1. These background and text combinations are easier to read, even though they use light colors.
- High contrast has a ratio of 16 :1. These designs are easy to read and use bolder colors for text that stand out on the backgrounds.  
- Maximum contrast has a ratio of 21 : 1. For the most contrast in your designs, like these, use black and white only.

The video Colors with Good Contrast from W3 showcases how luminosity contrast ratio affects users on a daily basis, from navigating street signs to conversing with a loved one.

To check the contrast ratio for your designs, WebAIM provides a Contrast Checker tool where you input the hex codes of colors from your designs. If your contrast ratio doesn’t meet the standards outlined above, you can use the tool's hue slider to adjust the colors and find new ones that meet the WCAG guidelines for accessible designs. 

#### Light sensitivity 

Some users are just as sensitive to bright light and bright colors as they are to low contrast. **Light sensitivity** is the inability to tolerate light. Users who have light sensitivity might experience your designs with a dim screen. Or they might use the operating system of their device to choose between light mode, dark mode, and high contrast mode, as shown in the image below. It's best to allow users to make these setting choices, so try designing your own light and dark modes of your own projects.

#### Consider color 

As always, the goal of designing a great user experience is to make people’s lives simpler and better. By following a few guidelines and designing with accessibility in mind, you’ll create products that are useful and fully accessible.

### Reading: Learn about more visual design elements

So far, you’ve learned about the importance of typography, color, and iconography in mockups. As you continue to design your own mockups, it’s also important to understand the most basic visual design elements, like lines, size, shape, and images. Here's a bit of good news: You don’t have to be artistic to use these elements as you design. So let’s check out each one!

**Lines:** A line is a straight figure connecting two points in space. In the world of UX design, lines can be used to differentiate sections of an app, connect two related ideas, or add emphasis to certain parts of the design. For example, you may choose to place a line below header text to draw additional emphasis to titles.

**Size:** The size of an element is in relation to other elements and factors that affect the design. Size is an especially important consideration when designing an app for a mobile phone screen size, which is pretty small. The size of elements can determine how users experience your design, for better or for worse. For example, a button that's too small can frustrate users or cause them to tap the wrong part of your design. 

**Shape:** Shape is defined as lines around a self-contained space that includes length and width. Shapes have a place in almost every app design, whether you use rectangles, squares, circles, or another shape. For example, to view more information within an app, there is often a circle with a plus sign (+) inside, which indicates that users can click the shape to expand a menu and learn more. Alternatively, to close out of a window in an app, app designs often use a circle with an X inside.

**Image:** In UX design, images are used to tell stories, make an impact without words, and add visual emphasis. Images can be static, like pictures and illustrations, or moving, like animations and GIFs. Either way, you should include images that are relevant to the story you want to tell with your design and that are relevant to the users you're designing for. For example, if your app for home repair services is addressing a specific problem that many users face, like a clogged gutter, it might be effective to include an image of a clogged gutter in your designs to drive emotional impact.   

#### Putting it all together

As you continue to design your own mockups using visual design elements, keep in mind these two things: 

**Visual appeal:** Consider how the content of your designs will be experienced by users in the real world. Are your lines connecting or dividing the right design elements? Are any shapes accidentally overlapping? Did your image upload correctly to Figma? You'll want to review your work with a heightened attention to detail, specifically looking for elements of your designs that might not be the most visually appealing.

**Accessibility:** As you design mockups, think about how users with various accessibility needs might react to the elements you include. For example, do headers stand out from the information placed below, by using lines or another visual design element? And, do all of your images have alternative text? Ensuring that your designs are accessible for everyone is critical to making your work a success!

As you continue to apply visual design elements in your mockups and beyond, reference this short guide from Usability.gov about visual design basics. It covers the elements you've learned in this part of the course and more!

### Create grids in mockups

Grids are a helpful and practical tool to use as you create designs. Grids give consistency and structure to your design, and they help ensure that your designs fit within the screen boundaries. 

Remember, a **basic grid** has intersecting lines that divide pages into small squares that allow you to easily lay out elements in a design. If you used grid paper to draw your wireframes, a basic grid will look familiar! A basic grid is on the left in the image above.

Basic grids are useful to help you design consistently, but UX designers more commonly use layout grids. A layout grid is a series of columns and alleys that allow you to organize elements in a design. Columns are the colored blocks, and alleys are the uncolored spaces between the columns. A layout grid is shown on the right in the image above. 
 
You can also apply more than one grid to a frame and edit them separately. So let's explore how to use grids in Figma!

#### Create and apply grids 

To apply a layout grid to your designs in Figma:

1. Select the **Frame** in the **Layers** panel or on the canvas. If you're working on a file you've already started designing, be sure that you’re selecting the Frame and not another element’s layer by accident. 

2. On the right side of the screen is the **Properties** panel. In the **Layout grid** section, click the **+** icon.

3. By default, a basic grid, which Figma calls a **Uniform Grid**, will be applied to the Frame. Uniform grid gets it's name because all of the squares in the grid are a uniform size.

4. You can update the properties by clicking on the icon with nine squares, in the shape of a square, to the left of Grid to open the **Layout grid** settings.

Check out Figma’s Help Center to learn some tips for using grids and to explore types of grids (uniform, column, row), including a visual with an example of each type of grid.

#### Align the elements to a grid

A **control** is a feature that helps you align design elements. In Figma, controls are located at the top of the Properties panel. Aligning the elements on your Frame to a grid will help your layout appear even, organized, and "tidy," as Figma describes it. 

Here are the controls in Figma, in the order listed below:

- Align left
- Align horizontal centers
- Align right
- Align top
- Align vertical centers
- Distribute horizontally
- Distribute vertically
- Tidy up

#### Auto Layout

Another feature in Figma that you might want to use when creating mockups is Auto Layout. With Auto Layout, your designs can shrink or grow in response to a change. For example, you can create buttons that grow or shrink as you edit their text label. 

There are a few ways you can add Auto Layout, such as:

1. Select a frame, then click the **plus (+)** icon next to Auto Layout in the right sidebar.
2. Right-click the frame or object, then select **Add Auto Layout**.
3. Use the keyboard shortcut **Shift + A**.

#### Stay inside the lines

Using grids can help improve the consistency and visual appeal of your mockups, so be sure to use them! To learn more, check out this video tutorial from Figma on alignment and distribution will take you through the steps to perform these actions directly in Figma. Or, read this article from Figma's blog that explains layout grids everything you need to know about layout grids.
